#React Web Application 

##Running the application locally:
* Copy contents of Git repo: https://github.com/navonf/EmployeeTracker
* Run 
``` bash 
npm install
````
* This will make sure you have all dependecies installed into your node_modules folder
* Change your current directory to EmpoyeeTracker/client
* run the command:
``` bash
npm start
```
* This should start the web application on localhost:3000

* If local method does not work you can access the web app online, hosted by Firebase:

```bash 
https://employee-tracker-team-6.firebaseapp.com
```
(the above method may not work if Firebase has stoppe hosting, but a good alternative if it works.)
